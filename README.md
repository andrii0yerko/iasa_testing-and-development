Chosen programming language - **JAVA**

# Home Task 4: WebAPI basics
The aim of this task is to get basic WebAPI knowledge by covering some Dropbox API with tests.

Notice that you should have your own Auth token to reproduce these requests both in Java app and Postman.

To use Java tests enter your token to field `bearerToken` in `Config.java`. To use Postman collection create a variable named `AuthToken` and put your token in it.

This branch contains the Maven project, so you can simply run it with `mvn test` from the project directory, or export to your IDE (I'm using IntelliJ IDEA).
